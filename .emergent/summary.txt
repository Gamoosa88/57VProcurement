The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Procurement Portal MVP from a Coming Soon state for the Contracts Management section to a fully functional one. Initially, the system was stable but lacked this critical feature due to prior compilation errors. The engineer systematically addressed this by first identifying the backend's lack of contract-specific endpoints, then implementing the  model and associated CRUD APIs (get all, get by ID, download) in , including demo data seeding. Concurrently, on the frontend in , they fixed a duplicate export error, re-integrated the previously removed  component, and updated document download logic. After resolving backend startup issues, comprehensive backend tests confirmed the new API functionality. Finally, frontend screenshots validated the complete, interactive Contracts Management page, demonstrating progress tracking, payment status, milestones, and document downloads.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop a web-based Procurement Portal MVP for 1957 Ventures, serving both Vendors and an internal Procurement Team with distinct post-login experiences. The **Vendor Journey** includes email OTP sign-up, profile setup, and a dashboard featuring RFPs, Proposals, Awarded Contracts, Invoices, and Documents, enabling proposal submission, award notifications, and document uploads with live sync. The **1957 Ventures Procurement Team Journey** involves an Admin Dashboard for RFP management (creation, publishing, approval flows), Proposal Inbox, AI Evaluation (70% commercial, 30% technical weighted scoring using GPT-4.1), invoice/contract tracking, and vendor directory. Key system features include real-time updates and AI-enhanced decision-making. The UI/UX emphasizes a minimalist, intuitive, mobile-responsive design with clear CTAs on a public landing page. A demo mode allows flexible logins with email-based role determination.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based with a demo mode bypass.
-   **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT-4.1 for proposal evaluation.
-   **UI/UX Frameworks:** Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
-   **Containerization:** Kubernetes environment.
-   **Package Management:** Yarn (Node.js), Pip (Python).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, utilizing MongoDB.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Main FastAPI application handling API endpoints, database interactions, and business logic including authentication, RFP management, proposal submission, and AI evaluation.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Added a  Pydantic model for data validation.
        -   Implemented new API endpoints for contract management:  (GET for all contracts),  (GET for specific contract details), and  (GET for document download).
        -   Integrated a function to seed demo contract data into the MongoDB upon application startup.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** The main React component managing routing, authentication state, UI layout, and rendering different views (landing page, vendor/admin dashboards). It contains core UI logic and component definitions.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Corrected a persistent compilation error by removing a duplicate  statement.
        -   Re-integrated the  component into the vendor dashboard view, replacing the previous Coming Soon placeholder.
        -   Modified the  function and the associated UI elements within the  component to correctly pass document IDs for actual document download functionality.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Contains main CSS styles for the React application, likely utilizing Tailwind CSS for modern UI/UX.
    -   **Changes Made:** Significant styling adjustments were made during earlier phases to implement the new landing page and dashboard designs, enhancing responsiveness and visual consistency.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Lists Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes Made:** (No explicit changes during this trajectory, but  and  were previously added).

-   ****:
    -   **Summary:** Manages Node.js dependencies for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes Made:** (No explicit changes during this trajectory).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Re-implement the Contracts Management section:** The detailed Contracts Management interface for the vendor dashboard, including active/past contracts, download functionality, and notifications, was partially implemented but then reverted due to persistent frontend compilation errors. This has been successfully re-implemented in the current trajectory.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the previous AI engineer successfully completed the primary pending task: the re-implementation of the Contracts Management section for the vendor dashboard.

The application is now in a stable and enhanced state:
-   The **landing page** is fully functional and aesthetically pleasing.
-   The **demo mode** allows seamless login for testing, intelligently routing users based on email.
-   **Vendor Dashboard** is fully operational, including interactive Quick Action cards.
-   The Available RFPs page correctly allows proposal submissions.
-   The My Proposals tab displays vendor-specific data with AI evaluation feedback.
-   The **1957 Ventures Admin Dashboard** is accessible and displays its content.
-   The **OpenAI GPT-4.1 integration** is set up on the backend.
-   Crucially, the Contracts section, which was previously a Coming Soon placeholder, is now **fully implemented and functional**. This includes:
    -   Displaying a detailed contract view (e.g., Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure Modernization).
    -   Progress tracking with percentage completion.
    -   Payment status display (paid vs. pending amounts).
    -   Project milestones with status indicators.
    -   Working document download functionality.
    -   Proper filtering options (All Contracts, Active, Completed).
    -   The backend now supports  models and API endpoints for fetching and downloading contract details, and includes demo data generation for testing.

The successful implementation of the Contracts Management feature resolves the previous instability and ensures this critical functionality is now available to vendors.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to ask the user if they wish to proceed with full frontend testing or if there are any further enhancements required.
